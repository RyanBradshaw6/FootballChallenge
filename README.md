Used VStack and HStack to create a message that says "What is football to you?", above three different symbols of people playing football. 
Used resizable() and scaleToFit() as well as foregroundStyle() to fit the symbols properly.
Also update the font weight, size, and color of the message to fit the challenge parameters.
